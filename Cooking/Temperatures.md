# Below 'safe' | Beef, lamb and veal joints and steaks
Many people prefer to eat meat likes beef, lamb, veal and fish below the recommended 'safe' temperature for a more juicy, tender mouthful. Whilst I'd never do this with poultry, I do think if you've got a very fresh piece of steak it's better to eat it at medium-rare so that you get the full, juicy flavour.

|Fahrenheit|Celsius|Stage|French|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|115-120°F|46-49°C|extra-rare or blue|‘bleu’|very red and cold
|125-130°F|52-55°C|rare|‘saignant’| cold red centre, soft to the touch
|130-140°F|55-60°C|medium rare|‘à point’|warm red centre, firmer
|140-150°F|60-65°C|medium|‘demi-anglais’|pink and firm
|150-155°F|65-69°C|medium well|‘cuit’|small bit of pink in the middle
|160+°F|71+°C|well done|‘bien cuit’|greyish/brown colour inside and out

Drop of water in to test temperature:
+ Cooking: If it fades away 
+ Meat: Dissolves fast or even crackles

Other things:
