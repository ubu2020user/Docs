1. **Think**
   + Imagine their thoughts about moving from the present to the future.

   + How will their perspectives affect their responses to your call to action?
   + Think through the mind-sets that might challenge them (Buying Barrier)
2. **Feel**
   + Imagin all the the emotions that your dream might evoke in your travelers.
   + How do they feel about the change and what you're asking of them?
   + How will the challenges affect their moods and motivation?
   + When might they feel most excited and inspired?
3. **Do**

   + What might they do in support of your dream, or to protest it?
   + How will the process affect their routines?
   + Will those changes be readily adopted or resisted?
