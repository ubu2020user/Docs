## Visual
Symbols we see through images or objects that make meaning tangible.

Your venture may have an image displayed on banners, your story may reference a token hidden under audience members' seats, or fireworks may shoot off just at the right time during your speech.

## Auditory
Symbols we hear through words and sounds or group expression.

A declaration may be shouted, a bell may be rung, or rousing music may be played at the end of a speech. Travelers may read a new mission statement together, which feels liturgical, or sing wistfully in unity.

## Spatial
Symbolic spaces - wether sacred or historic - create another layer of meaning when people gather there. 

A story could be told at a venue where actual events unfolded, or a speech can be delivered at a historic location that makes it take on a sacraed nature. A ceromony communicates meaning by creating a serene or spectacular setting.

## Physical 
Our gesture and outfits communicate what we feel and whom we align with.

Sad travelers may hug and happy ones may dance in the aisles at the end of a speech. Travelers may wear a button to show their solidarity with others during a ceremony.
