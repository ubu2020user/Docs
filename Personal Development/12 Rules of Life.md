# 12 Rules of Life
by Jordan Peterson
## 1. Stand up straight with you shoulders back.
> Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your Being. As the great nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so brilliantly noted, 'He whose life has a why can bear almost any how.' ~ Jordan Peterson
## 2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for 
Respect yourself and know that you are worthy of help. You are important to other people, as much as you are to yourself. 
## 3. Make friends with people who want the best for you
> You are the average of the five people you spent most time with.
## 4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.
You are now connected to billions of people online. You can't compare yourself to others. And if you do it is unfair because they feature other advantages and disadvantages as you have. 
> You can't compare apples and bananas. ~ Math lecture    

You can only grow by yourself not others.
## 5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
First Accept the innate aggression found in humans. This is why almost everyone has a story of being bullied as a child. To overcome this aggression your primary concern should be raising kind children. This doesn't mean you should become your child's best friend. 
1. Never use violence unless in self-defence.
2. Show others kindness and respect.
Avoid rules like:
+ ~~You must always be in bed by 7 p.m.~~
+ ~~You must never have mismatched socks.~~
## 6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
1. Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?
2. Are you working hard on your career? Or, are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?
3. Have you made peace with your brother & sister?
4. Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect?
5. Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?
## 7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
Seek sacrifice rather than instant gratification. This sacrifice must be for the benefit of others rather than your own benefit.   
> Peterson explains that these small positive impacts will help you grow like a lotus flower. These flowers start at the bottom of a muddy lake and slowly grow. Eventually, lotus flowers burst out beautifully in the sunlight.
## 8. Tell the truth ~~*or, at least, don't lie*~~
> If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you cling despereately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling the truth. If you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused, try telling the truth. In Paradise everyone speaks the truth. That is what makes it Paradise. Tell the truth. ~ Jordan Peterson
## 9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't
(Sigmund Freud suggests the same.)
If you listen instead, without judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking-and with little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd and intriguing details. Few of your conversations will be boring!
## 10. Be precise in your speech

## 11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
## 12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street
